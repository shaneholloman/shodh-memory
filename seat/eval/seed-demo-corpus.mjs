 * The corpus is written to exercise every subsystem the workbench renders,
 * deliberately:
 *  - explicit causal language ("because", "led to", "triggered") for the
 *    causal extractors → typed lineage edges, not bare co-occurrence;
 *  - named people, organisations, places and systems → a visibly typed
 *    ontology once NER typing lands (person/org/location/technology);
 *  - place names in text → toponym linking (gazetteer), distinct from…
 *  - …real recorded coordinates on field events → the geo layer;
 *  - repeated entities across memories → canonicalization + Hebbian edges;
 *  - a deliberate factual correction pair → the facts contradiction path;
 *  - open todos → Tasks.
 *
 * Idempotence: re-running adds duplicates. Seed fresh stores only.
