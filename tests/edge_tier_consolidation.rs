//! Edge-tier consolidation on a BATCH-INGESTED store.
//!
//! Every import, every eval run and every seeded deployment ingests its corpus
//! in one pass, so every edge is created within minutes of every other edge.
//! Promotion used to be gated purely on wall-clock separation since an edge
//! entered its tier (30 min L1→L2, 24 h L2→L3), which such a store can never
//! satisfy: the entire graph stayed at `L1Working`, carrying `EDGE_TIER_TRUST_L1`
//! (0.20, a 4x retrieval-trust penalty against L3) and aging out on the L1 prune
//! schedule. The gate now also accepts distinct attesting *episodes*, which is
//! what the clock was standing in for.
//!
//! These tests measure that on a real RocksDB store built from a real corpus
//! through the real `add_relationship` ingest path, and pin the invariants that
//! keep the result defensible in BOTH directions: no edge may be promoted
//! without independent evidence, and no edge WITH independent evidence may be
//! left frozen at L1.
//!
//! Run with `--nocapture` to see the census and the episode histogram.
