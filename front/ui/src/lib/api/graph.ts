/**
 * The hop from an entity back to the memories it was extracted from.
 *
 * There is no purpose-built "memories for this entity" endpoint. The exact
 * reverse index exists in the store — `get_episodes_by_entity`
 * (src/graph_memory.rs:5003-5050) is literally this lookup — but no HTTP
 * handler routes it. What IS routed is edge provenance, and that is enough,
 * because of one fact that makes the whole hop work:
 *
 *   An episode's uuid IS the memory id. Episodes are created with
 *   `uuid: memory_id.0` (src/handlers/state.rs:3349-3350) and the idempotency
 *   check reads `get_episode(&memory_id.0)` (state.rs:3302).
 *
 * So every `source_episode_id` on a relationship edge is a memory id, and
 * `POST /api/graph/episode/get` hydrates it into readable content.
 *
 * ONE HONEST LIMIT, surfaced in the UI rather than hidden: this is
 * edge-derived. An edge only exists between two entities, so a memory whose
 * extraction produced fewer than two entities creates no edge and is invisible
 * here (the pair loop at state.rs:3373+). This finds memories that connected
 * this entity to another, not every memory that named it.
