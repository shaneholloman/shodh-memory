/**
 * Primary navigation — an icon rail that expands on hover or focus.
 *
 * Names are what the thing is, not what the subsystem is called:
 *   Recall     — the search surface (was "Live")
 *   Anomalies  — deviations from this user's own baseline (was unqualified)
 *   Tasks      — the todo list (was "Work", which named nothing)
 *
 * The rail is Gridline's structure with two deliberate departures. Its icons
 * are sized for a far sparser screen than this one, so they are smaller here.
 * And Gridline leaves the rail icon-only, hanging labels off tooltips — seven
 * unlabelled glyphs is a memory game, and a tooltip only pays out after you
 * have already guessed which one to point at. Expanding the whole column
 * instead shows every label at once, which is the question a person actually
 * has ("which of these is the one I want?").
 *
 * Three things this has to get right, none of them optional — all three
 * verified in a browser, not assumed:
 *
 *  - It expands as an OVERLAY. The stage behind it holds a graph; reflowing a
 *    force layout because a pointer crossed the edge of the screen is
 *    disorienting, and it re-lays-out the very thing being pointed at.
 *  - Focus expands it exactly as hover does, and the labels are in the DOM at
 *    all times — clipped, never absent — so a screen reader is never handed a
 *    column of bare icons.
 *  - Leaving is delayed. Pointers travel diagonally toward content and clip
 *    the rail's corner on the way out; closing on the first mouseleave makes
 *    it flicker.
 *
 * Reduced motion is handled globally in index.css, which collapses every
 * transition to 0.01ms — this component needs no separate branch for it.
 */

/**
 * The destinations, and the one line each of them is.
 *
 * A caption is not a tooltip and not a tagline. It is what someone needs in
 * order to know what they are looking at the moment they arrive, so it says
 * what the DATA on that screen is, in the words a person would use. Four rules
 * it is held to, all of them learned from copy that failed them:
 *
 *  - No subsystem words. "corpus", "session store", "spreading activation" name
 *    parts of this program, not things a reader has.
 *  - True of the screen as it opens, not of the screen after work. Geo used to
 *    promise "the current results" and then opened onto the whole map, which
 *    reads as the wrong screen rather than as a fuller one.
 *  - It labels; it does not sell. No adjective that the screen cannot be
 *    checked against.
 *  - A NOUN PHRASE, NOT A SENTENCE, AND UNDER SIX WORDS. These were clauses —
 *    "Search this memory, and see what connects to what" — sitting permanently
 *    beside a one-word title in a 48px bar, on every screen, on every visit.
 *    The caption has to survive being read at a glance by someone who has read
 *    it forty times before, and a clause does not: it gets skipped, which makes
 *    it cost its space and pay nothing. Naming the data in three words is read
 *    every time.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT moved behind an info affordance, and this is the one place
 * in the density pass where that was the wrong tool. The documented failure
 * this caption was added to fix is people arriving somewhere and not knowing
 * what the data means — and by definition those people do not know there is
 * anything to ask about, so an icon pays out to nobody. It gets shorter; it
 * does not get hidden.
 *
 * Read in two places — the rail (`Placeholder`, for destinations with nothing
 * behind them yet) and the header, next to the title (TopBar.tsx). Both read it
 * from here so the app cannot describe one destination two ways.
