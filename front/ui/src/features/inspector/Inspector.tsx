/**
 * The Inspector — the single object-detail surface.
 *
 * WORKFLOWS.md: every list in the product feeds this one pane, and it always
 * offers the next hop. That is what makes a click lead somewhere instead of
 * terminating.
 *
 * It reads the recall result from the react-query cache under the same key the
 * result list used, rather than taking it as a prop or refetching. Recall is
 * expensive and its response already contains everything shown here —
 * attribution, lineage, facts. Asking again to render a detail view would pay
 * the full retrieval cost twice for data already in memory.
 *
 * Positioned absolutely rather than as a flex column so the d3 canvas can later
 * take the stage's full width with this floated over its right edge. Until then
 * `main` reserves the same width, so nothing is occluded.

  // Recall now opens onto the corpus rather than onto an instruction: with no
  // query, the result column lists the newest memories and every row selects
  // into this pane exactly like a result. But those rows come from the corpus
  // listing, and the recall cache under an empty query has never been
  // populated — so every one of those clicks landed here, found nothing, and
  // was answered with "search, then select a result". A list whose rows are
  // invitations and whose clicks say "do something else first" is a dead end in
  // the one place the product asks a stranger to start.
  //
  // Both are read with `queryFn: skipToken`, which subscribes to a cache entry
  // and can never issue the request itself. This replaces a bare
  // `getQueryData` read, for a reason the earlier note here did not anticipate:
  // a cache read is not a subscription, and both of these entries resolve
  // underneath an Inspector that is already mounted — the corpus fetch lands on
  // the first paint of /recall, and a fresh recall lands while a memory from the
  // previous result set is still selected. Neither re-rendered this pane, so it
  // went on showing a pre-load message, or a selected memory stripped of the
  // attribution the response had just delivered, until something unrelated
  // happened to re-render it.
  //
  // `skipToken` is specifically what the old note was reaching for and could not
  // name: `enabled: false` with no `queryFn` registers a query that throws on an
  // unpopulated key — which IS the first-paint case here — while `skipToken` is
  // the supported form for "read this key, never fetch it". `useCorpus`/
  // `useRecall` are not reused because both need `Reachability`, which this pane
  // is not given and does not need: it only ever reads what those two wrote.
