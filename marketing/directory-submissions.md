**Submit at:** https://mcpmarket.com/submit

**GitHub Repository URL:**
```
https://github.com/varun29ankuS/shodh-memory
```

**Description:**
```
Persistent memory for AI agents with Hebbian learning, 3-tier cognitive architecture, and knowledge graphs. Single ~15MB binary that runs offline on cloud, edge devices, or air-gapped systems. Features semantic search, spreading activation, and neuroscience-inspired memory consolidation.
```

## 2. AIAgentsList.com

**Submit at:** https://aiagentslist.com (look for Submit in navigation)

**GitHub Repository URL:**
```
https://github.com/varun29ankuS/shodh-memory
```

**Name:** shodh-memory

**Description:**
```
Cognitive memory system for AI agents. 3-tier architecture (working → session → long-term), Hebbian learning for association strengthening, hybrid decay (exponential + power-law), and semantic + graph-based retrieval. Runs offline as single binary.
```

**Category:** Memory & Knowledge Management

**Language:** Rust

**Scope:** Local

**Features/Tools:**
- remember - Store memories with semantic indexing
- recall - Semantic search across all memories
- proactive_context - Auto-surface relevant memories
- recall_by_tags - Tag-based filtering
- context_summary - Quick overview of learnings
- consolidation_report - Memory system introspection

## Why should this server be added?

Shodh-memory provides persistent, cognitive memory for AI agents that:

1. **Learns with use** - Hebbian learning strengthens frequently-accessed associations
2. **Runs offline** - Single ~15MB binary, no cloud dependency
3. **Edge-deployable** - Works on Jetson, Raspberry Pi, air-gapped systems
4. **Neuroscience-grounded** - 3-tier architecture based on Cowan's working memory model
5. **Fast** - <1μs graph lookup, 34-58ms semantic search

**Key differentiators vs other memory MCPs:**
- Not just vector search - includes knowledge graph with spreading activation
- Hybrid decay model (exponential + power-law) based on cognitive research
- Memory replay and interference detection
- 688 tests passing, production-ready

**Ideal for Cline users who:**
- Work on long-running projects needing persistent context
- Want memory that strengthens useful associations automatically
- Need offline/edge deployment capability
```
