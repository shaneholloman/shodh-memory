//! Offline entity knowledge base: surface form → stable real-world identity.
//!
//! The canonicalizer merges surface forms it has *seen together*; GLiNER types
//! them. Neither can tell that `IBM` and `International Business Machines` are
//! one company, because that fact is not in the corpus — it is world knowledge.
//! This module supplies it, deterministically and entirely on-device, in the
//! same spirit as [`crate::gazetteer`]: a vendored asset, no network, no model,
//! and an explicit refusal to guess.
//!
//! # What "linked" means
//!
//! A linked entity carries a Wikidata QID in
//! [`EntityNode::kb_id`](crate::graph_memory::EntityNode::kb_id). Two nodes with
//! the same `kb_id` are the same real-world thing — that is the whole claim.
//! Stamping the id does **not** by itself merge the nodes; merging is a separate,
//! riskier decision gated behind `SHODH_KB_LINKING` (see
//! `GraphMemory::kb_link_entities`).
//!
//! # Resolution rules (v1)
//!
//! Candidate generation is **case-insensitive exact match** on a canonical label
//! or a known alias — no fuzzy matching, no edit distance, no prefix search. The
//! one tolerated variation is a trailing legal designator (`Inc.`, `Corp.`,
//! `GmbH`, …), stripped from both sides, so `International Business Machines`
//! reaches `International Business Machines Corporation`. That is a deterministic
//! token rule, not a similarity score.
//!
//! Disambiguation, in order:
//!
//! 1. **Type blocking.** The mention's coarse type must map to a KB type
//!    ([`kb_type_for_label`]) and the candidate must carry it. A mention typed
//!    `Person` never links to an organisation. Mentions whose type is generic
//!    (`Concept`, `Keyword`, …) are refused outright — an untyped surface carries
//!    too little evidence to link safely.
//! 2. **Sole survivor links.** Exactly one type-compatible candidate → link.
//! 3. **Dominance or abstain.** With several candidates, the most prominent must
//!    beat the runner-up by [`DOMINANCE_RATIO`]× in Wikipedia sitelink count.
//!    Otherwise the result is [`Resolution::Abstained`] and **nothing is linked**.
//!
//! Rule 3 is the load-bearing one. `ACM` is the Association for Computing
//! Machinery to a software engineer and AC Milan to everyone else; `WTO` is the
//! World Trade Organization (153 sitelinks) or the Warsaw Pact (116). A wrong
//! link is strictly worse than no link: it asserts that two distinct real-world
//! things are one, and every downstream traversal inherits the error. So the
//! default under uncertainty is to refuse.
//!
//! Note this deliberately departs from the gazetteer's population argmax. The
//! gazetteer collapses homonyms when it *builds* its index, which makes
//! abstention impossible by construction; here every candidate for a surface
//! survives into the index so the ambiguity is visible at lookup time.
